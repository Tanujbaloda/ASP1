                At Ankuram, we believe every child is unique and full of potential. Our journey began with a simple
                vision: to create a joyful and secure learning space where young minds feel valued, nurtured, and
                inspired.

              <p className="mb-6">
                Our school caters to children from Pre-Nursery to Class II. Rooted in love and guided by the Montessori
                philosophy, we provide an environment where children grow not just academically but emotionally,
                socially, and creatively.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-6">
                Our classrooms are vibrant spaces filled with laughter, discovery, and meaningful play. With
                age-appropriate Montessori materials, hands-on activities, and a child-centered approach, we aim to make
                learning a natural and enjoyable experience.

              <p className="text-lg font-medium text-gray-800">
                We take pride in being a second home for childrenâ€”a place where they feel safe, respected, and happy
                every single day.
